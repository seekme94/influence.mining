\usage{
coreness_influential(
  graph,
  budget = 1,
  test_method = c("RESILIENCE", "INFLUENCE_LT", "INFLUENCE_IC")

\arguments{
\item{graph}{is the igraph object}

\item{budget}{number of influential nodes to be fetched. Default value is 1}

\item{test_method}{specifies the method to measure influence. Value MUST be "RESILIENCE", "INFLUENCE_IC" or "INFLUENCE_LT"}
}
